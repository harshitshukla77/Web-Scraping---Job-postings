# Problem Statement

The job market is constantly evolving, with new opportunities and requirements emerging daily. However, identifying trends and understanding the current job market landscape can be challenging due to the vast amount of information scattered across various job portals. This project aims to bridge this gap by collecting, analyzing, and visualizing job postings from Indeed and Glassdoor using web scraping techniques. 

# Description:

This project involves the web scraping of job postings from Indeed and Glassdoor to collect raw data on various job roles, required skills, companies, locations, and salary ranges. The primary objective of this phase is to build a comprehensive dataset that can be used for further analysis and insights into job market trends.

# Key Features:

* Web Scraping: Utilized Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Selenium to extract job postings from Indeed and Glassdoor, focusing on a range of job titles and industries.
* Data Collection: Gathered data on job titles, company names, locations, job descriptions, and salary information, storing it in a structured format (CSV/JSON).
* Data Storage: The collected data is stored in CSV/JSON files, making it easily accessible for future analysis.

# Technologies Used:

* Python (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy)
* Data Storage (CSV, JSON)
* Jupyter Notebook (for data inspection and basic processing)

# Outcome:
This project provides a structured dataset of job postings from Indeed and Glassdoor, ready for exploratory data analysis and visualization. The dataset serves as a foundation for identifying job market trends, understanding employer requirements, and exploring geographical distributions of job opportunities.
